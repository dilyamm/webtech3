                    <h2>Franz Kafka</h2>
                    <p>Franz Kafka (3 July 1883 – 3 June 1924) was a German-language novelist and writer from Prague. He is widely regarded as a major 
                        figure of 20th-century literature. His work fuses elements of realism and the fantastic. It typically features isolated protagonists 
                        facing bizarre or surrealistic predicaments and incomprehensible socio-bureaucratic powers. It has been interpreted as exploring themes 
                        of alienation, existential anxiety, guilt, and absurdity. His best known works include the novella The Metamorphosis and novels The Trial 
                        and The Castle. The term Kafkaesque has entered English to describe absurd situations like those depicted in his writing.</p>

                        to find himself inexplicably transformed into a huge insect and struggles to adjust to this condition. The novella has been widely 
                        discussed among literary critics, who have offered varied interpretations. In popular culture and adaptations of the novella, 
                        the insect is commonly depicted as a cockroach.</p>

Scrupulously following the fluidity and breathlessness of the sparsely punctuated original manuscript, Mark Harman’s new translation reveals levels of comedy, energy, and visual power, previously unknown to English language readers.</p>

                    <p class="book-description">The passionate but doomed epistolary love affair between a Czech translator and one of the greatest writers of the twentieth century, the author of The Metamorphosis and The Trial. 

                        "Extraordinary, touching, horrifying, brilliant, sickly, [and] heartbreaking…. The most significant key we have for a reading of the author's novels and short stories." —The New York Times
                        
                        In no other work does Franz Kafka reveal himself as in Letters to Milena, which begins as a business correspondence but soon develops into an epistolary love affair. Kafka's Czech translator, Milena Jesenská, was a gifted and charismatic twenty-three-year-old who was uniquely able to recognize Kafka's complex genius and his even more complex character. For thirty-six-year-old Kafka, she was "a living fire, such as I have never seen." It was to Milena that he revealed his most intimate self and, eventually, entrusted his diaries for safekeeping.</p>
